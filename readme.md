# JavaScript Code Style

## What is Code Style?

A set of recommended conventions for styling your code. Styling includes:

* variable, function, and class naming
* indentation
* comments
* use of white space
* placement of opening and closing brackets
* many others...

Often a specific Code Style is documented in a Style Guide. There are many style guides to choose from, such as:

* [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
* [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml)
* [W3 Schools JavaScript Conventions](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp)
* [jQuery's JavaScript Style Guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)

## Why is Good Code Style Important?

* Readability (for others and your future self)
* Consistancy - all of the code in a specific project is consistantly formatted
* Helps in identifying and removing careless mistakes (typos)
* Helps in identifying WET code - DRY it up!

## Tools: Linters, Beautifiers, and Editor Plugins

There are many tools that can help us write well-styled code.

### Linters

Linters are tools that analyze our source code looking for code style violations and potential bugs. Popular JavaScript code linters are:

* [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/)
* [JSHint](http://jshint.com/)
* [JavaScript Code Style - JSCS](http://jscs.info/)
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)
